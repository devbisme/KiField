A utility for manipulating part fields in KiCad schematic files or libraries.
KiField can extract all the component fields from a schematic or library
and place them into a spreadsheet for bulk editing, after which you can insert the
edited values from the spreadsheet back into the schematic or library.

KiField is usually employed in a three-step process:

#. First use KiField to extract the part field labels and values from a
   schematic or library and place them into a CSV or XLSX spreadsheet file.

#. Edit the spreadsheet file to change existing field values, add entirely
   new fields, or completely delete fields.

#. Finally, use KiField to insert the updated field labels and values from
   the spreadsheet file into the schematic or library.
